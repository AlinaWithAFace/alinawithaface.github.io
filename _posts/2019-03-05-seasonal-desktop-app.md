I'm particularly a fan of games that change along with real-time clocks. Animal Crossing is the really prominent example of this, but outside games I don't know if there's a ton of dynamic applications that have that dash of flavor over the year and seasons. So, to compensate slash because I wanted to, I wrote a small python script that simply changes your desktop wallpaper to a thematically similar one every month. Feel free to download it [here](https://github.com/AlinaWithAFace/seasonal-desktop-wallpapers). The images were ~~stolen~~ borrowed from google calendar because I'm not an illustrator (yet?).

Anyway you can either run it once a month manually, or throw a shortcut into a place to automate it.

Have fun!

So, I stumbled upon [Thomas Frank's Impossible List](https://collegeinfogeek.com/about/meet-the-author/my-impossible-list/) early in my college days, and thought it was pretty fantastic. He picked it up from this other guy [Joel Runyon](https://impossiblehq.com/impossible-list/) who goes into the philosophy behind it [here](https://impossiblehq.com/the-impossible-list-is-not-a-bucket-list/).

Anyway here's mine. It's been floating around on different people's services and tools in various forms, but I decided it would be best to compile it on something I had a bit more control over. As with others, it's dynamic and personal.

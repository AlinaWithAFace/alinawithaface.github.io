title:  "The Forty Hour Work Week"

“Eight hours labour, eight hours recreation, eight hours rest” was one of the industrial revolution’s many cries for worker’s rights. Coined by Robert Owen sometime around 1817 (Deb par. 4), the forty-hour work week consisting of five eight-hour days didn’t really come into mainstream fruition until Henry Ford set it as the standard in his factories in 1914 (“Gives $10,000,000 To 26,000 Employees”). This is not a concrete standard; modern worker’s benefits are shifting constantly, with some organizations trying to reduce overall working hours. But how did we get here? Why eight hours? Why did it take over a century?

### Then

The industrial revolution was a period of immense change. Technological advancements were rampant throughout both England and the United States, and as a result the typical work day of sunrise to sundown on the family farm became irrelevant. People were able to leave their country jobs in droves to begin working in factories located in densely populated cities.

Factories were much different from anything anyone had ever worked with before. Unlike agrarian professions, they defied the natural clock of the sun and ran as frequently as possible, with workers clocking in for twelve, fourteen, or even sixteen hours per day.

One such factory owner was Henry Ford. Historian Douglass Brinkley said of Ford that “Efficiency [became] a religion to [him]. Time is a product; you get the maximum you can out of every hour (“American Experience: Henry Ford”).” It was the one of Ford’s highest priorities; he wanted his plants running as smoothly as possible, pushing workers into carefully and coldly calculated assembly lines that turned people and their very movements into mechanical operations. Ford paid people to “Stand in one place all day long and do the same repetitive task over and over and over again (“American Experience: Henry Ford”)” this led to extremely high employee turnover. Workers were unable to take the monotony and physical exhaustion that Ford’s assembly line model required and excelled on, leading most to quit within a few days (“American Experience: Henry Ford”). For every hundred positions he wanted to fill, Ford had to hire a thousand men just to survive the mass of people who immediately quit. He solved this in 1914 by more than doubling the daily wages of every factory worker from $2.34 to five dollars, and reducing the shift length from nine hours to eight (“American Experience: Henry Ford”) This kept turnover low, and allowed his factories to continuously run 24 hours a day.

Prior to Ford, the movement toward the eight-hour day was a mere crawl. Over a century before this revolutionary change, socialist Robert Owen began to push for a ten hour working day, eventually coming to a goal of eight, along with the aforementioned slogan. All throughout the 1800’s, strike after strike and legislation after legislation affected minorities of workers within specific industries. Only the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1937 set an overarching standard across nearly all employed persons. Between Owen’s first proposal and the Fair Labor Standards Act, Ford was born, married, had his one child, and watched the establishment of two workers’ holidays (Wass).


Since then, the eight-hour day has become the standard. Full time workers who regularly work forty or more hours per week tend to be eligible for benefits such as retirement plans, health insurance, dental, etc., that part time workers are generally denied access to (Guerra par. 3). If anything, since the advent of the internet, the average American’s working hours have increased due to the global hyper-competitive economy!

### Now

We live in an era not of obvious ends in which we can see the thing that has been done and the thing which has yet to be done, but an era of “thought work”. Theoretically, almost anything you do work on, you could continue working on forever and it still could be improved upon. In his book “Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity,” David Allen explores the lack of concrete boundaries in thought work:

*How good could that conference potentially be?… How inspiring is the essay you’re writing? How motivating the staff meeting? How functional the reorganization? How much available data could be relevant to doing those projects “better”? The answer is an infinite amount… (5)*

When the work you do is no longer easily quantifiable, the value of time decreases in favor of pure creative energy. As anyone who has experienced writer’s block will know, throwing more time and energy into a problem doesn’t always help solve it.

Some people argue for shorter working days and weeks possibly because of the vast difference between the modern world’s mental and creative energy based work versus the physically intensive work of the 1900’s. One of the more recent examples of a six-hour-day experiment is the Svartedalens care home in Gothenburg, Sweden. Nurses “switched from an eight-hour to a six-hour working day for the same wage” leaving some feeling “much more alert (Crouch).” While the program was more expensive compared to their current costs due to the sudden need for staff, consultant Bengt Lorentzon reported that participants “have more energy, are less stressed and have more time for the residents, who themselves are more comfortable and relaxed (Crouch).” They placed more value on the quality of patient care and nurse health than sheer money or time, and while some large corporations in the US have similar employee benefits that “take care of the whole you and keep you healthy, whether physically, emotionally, financially or socially (Google),” it’s not the fastest growing trend.

While it’s impossible to say for sure where the average American worker’s benefits and policies are headed, companies within the technology sector in particular have tried unexpected things that could be considered on the same level as Ford’s five dollar a day wage. Practically every other company whose goal is to hire and keep great developers has a ‘quality of working life’ portion on their website bragging about how great it is to work there. Non-traditional benefits range from things like ping-pong tables, gaming consoles, and inhouse lunches to entire areas such as gyms and cafeterias (Labalme par. 1). One of the more prominent examples is tech giant Google, Inc., famous for its “Googleplex”, a 3.1 million square foot center containing entire workout rooms, swimming pools, cafeterias, and even an on-campus hairdresser (Strickland).

To recap, the forty-hour work week came about during the industrial revolution because of Henry Ford’s obsession with efficiency and need to keep people in dull, mechanical, and physically intensive jobs. Now, because the average person’s labor has been shifted from dull and demanding physical labor into creative and thought based work, an individual’s capacity to be creative and generate ideas has become more important than the sheer amount of time they pour into producing something. Because of this shift, shorter, energetic days have the capacity to be just as, if not more, productive than their eight hour counterparts, and may be one of the next steps forward for the working class.

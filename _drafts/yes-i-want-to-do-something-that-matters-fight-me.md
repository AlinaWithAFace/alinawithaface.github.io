I feel like people complain about how millenials/kids these days want to work on things that "matter" or "make an impact", as if that's a bad thing.

We've watched our parents work at dull soul sucking jobs just to survive for their entire lives, and complain about it, and then you're *shocked* that we aren't keen on doing the same thing?

What?

WHAT?

You're not allowed to be surprised about this.

oh and don't let me forget to mention how *fucking loud we are about things that matter* see: climate change is the big one right now but you know there's also other things probably

dammit i didn't want to go into politics when i grew up but if you can't get your shit together i'll run in 10 years and actually do shit i swear to god

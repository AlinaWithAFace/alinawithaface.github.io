# Kickstarting Delaware's Indie Game Dev Scene

Hi! My name is Alina, if you've been to La Pata Fria, I live there. This month I started the Delaware Games Collective, an organization dedicated to building a community of game makers, developers, and artists.

Delaware doesn't have a game dev scene, period. Occasionally you'll find one or two people working on a game in their free time, making something for academic purposes, or rarely running a successful Kickstarter, but there's not really a hub or even communication between all of these scattered groups. As someone in tech, I feel like I run into a lot of coders who have made games for their cisc classes or as a way to practice their coding skills, or as a person who knows people I'll see artists and writers who've expressed interest in 'someday working in games'.

Someday can be today. We're long past the point where the only way to work on games is by getting into AAA (triple A, i.e. really big budget games, think EA, Blizzard, Nintendo, Activision, etc). Tools like Unity and Unreal have made getting started on your own games easier than ever, and it's amazing! Even now, 3D modeling as we know it is drastically changing with the introduction of VR tools like Tiltbrush and Blocks that make it trivial for anyone to make their own models in minutes.

Part of my inspiration for starting the DGC was seeing the indie games scene at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. I was able to attend due to a scholarship from Glitch, a nonprofit in Minneapolis, which really focuses on empowering the new, the bold, and the small in their area. The entire experience and culture of having so many game makers in one space was incredibly inspiring, and I want to replicate that here!

I believe games are for everyone.

I believe anyone can make games.

They too, are art, and art can come from anywhere!

But they're also difficult to make alone, and the interdisciplinary nature of them is a really great chance to bring people with all kinds of skills and backgrounds together to make a common *thing*. I hope by starting the Delaware Games Collective, we can build up a culture of making and producing where there would otherwise only be consumption.

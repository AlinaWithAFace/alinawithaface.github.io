i have more siblings than you have fingers on one hand

we're pretty into games

we had an arcade when i was growing up

it was great

some games were super great for us as a group in different ways

like session-based stuff life left4dead was great

but also longer term things like borderlands 2 also worked out really well

overcoooooked

monster proooom

nitrome for daaaays

other things probably

gauntlet's pretty neat

my family's doing this thing where we're going to play betrayal at the house on the hill over the next 6 years. it's an adventure. if any of you spoil it i swear to god we can't be friends

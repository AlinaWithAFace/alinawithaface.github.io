like

if people have the resources to try making things without fearing for starvation and/or homelessness

maybe

they make cool shit

and don't have to sell out to survive

which is, you know, a good thing

but when you have healthcare and food money tied to a job, this doesn't become an option, you have to build your own runway to justify your existence

maybe that's all it comes down to in a sense, constantly having to justify your existence

which, if you hadn't noticed, is exhausting

and then people wonder why we have all of these health problems

you shouldn't feel pressured to get eaten by someone else's company to survive

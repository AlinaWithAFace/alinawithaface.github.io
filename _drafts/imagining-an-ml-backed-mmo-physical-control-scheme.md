mmos, traditionally, have many, many, many, *many* buttons
so much that they're spawned entire genres of mouse that host all of said buttons, in order to grant easy access to all of the various attacks and skills a given player will need in their adventure

but if you hadn't noticed, VR games don't exactly have this luxury. controllers here have a couple buttons, with some systems hardly having any control scheme in place at all as you're a head on a stick
specifics vary a bit from device to device, but the thing that non-mobile systems have in common is some fairly basic hand tracking via your controllers. beyond this, there are ways to track more of the body in virtual reality particularly using the vive pucks as something of a system, and i believe in the future we'll see more accurate and all-encompasing body tracking.

so, let's take a moment to dream

pretend for a moment that we have accurate, real-time full body motion tracking in virtual reality simulations. fantastic, we've completed decades of computing research in a sentence.

now what?

the ability to press a button doesn't mean anything unless it has some sort of reaction
there's no point in having all of this input without any reaction, any output

in the case where we have accurate real-time full body motion capture, running constantly in the background as a normal thing, what defines an action? what defines an input?

what distinguishes a motion from one with intent and purpose verses simply idling and subsiting in the world

this is maybe where machine learning models come in

show these models what intentful, purposeful motion looks like

punch the air in front of you 20 times, snap a finger, rub your tummy and pat your head, give these specific actions particular outputs that affect your world, and actually mean something

if you swing a sword, have it force things away from you
if you uppercut the air, force an enemy up, up, and awaaay


then, don't tell anyone what the specifics are

let them discover them themselves

train your model but don't tell your users what it's looking for, only for them to find out by simply playing, physically

even then, use that for passive states or buffs

if you're physically sitting down, maybe that should help your character ingame slowly recover health or stamina

integrate breaks and recovery periods into your gameplay loop, and make them an integral part of the game

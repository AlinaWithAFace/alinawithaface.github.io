"Lying to yourself about what you want to achieve is a very common hurdle, for people of all ranges of experience in fitness. Some people bury what they really want because they're afraid of being vain, or selfish, or otherwise being judged. This behavior will hinder you in achieving your goals no matter what they are. Somebody can always be found to judge you for what you want, because the world is full of bucket crabs and people suffering from tall poppy syndrome. Ignore them. If you don't get clear on what your real goals are, you can't pursue them effectively, and you may end up giving up because you are chasing a goal you don't actually want. It's also important to keep in mind that the best person to determine your goals is you, as only you can know or decide what you really want. Be receptive to the advice of experienced people, but don't let others dictate what your end game is or should be.

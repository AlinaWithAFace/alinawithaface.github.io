Hi

Sorry to do this to you, but you can't read this.

At least, not yet.

See I feel like this piece is a bit vulnerable. I don't know if I can trust you yet, given you could be anyone.

But there's not really a way to deal with that directly, so, enter patreon

I need you to be invested in my work and me as a person. I need you on my side.

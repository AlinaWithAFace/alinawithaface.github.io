I like
I like
I love?
But what does that even mean now?
L O V E
It's simultaneously used to describe your feelings about pizza on a Friday night
And the intimate connection you formed the Saturday morning afterwards
I love
Love food
Love dogs
Love family
Love you?
But you're not an Italian American amalgamation
You're the thing that hit me
That melts me with nothing but a glance
That thing that's off limits
Walled off
The thing I can look at but not touch
Even though I want nothing more than to indulge in your aura
Dive into your head and just inhale
Pheremones and knowledge alike
I want you to crawl up me and let me crawl in you
It's primal really
But then when I stop and think it feels silly
Like I'm just making it up as I go along
Based on the perception I have of a thing and not the actual human piloting it

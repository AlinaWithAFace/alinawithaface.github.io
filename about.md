# *Hi!*

I'm __*Alina Christenbury*__, an upcoming PhD student in the [Human Computer Interaction Lab](https://sites.udel.edu/hci-lab/) at the University of Delaware where my advisor is [Dr. Roghayeh Barmaki](https://sites.udel.edu/rlb/). I'm also part of the [Vertically Integrated Projects](https://vip.udel.edu/) (VIP) program where I'm advised by [Professor Andy Novocin](http://andy.novocin.com/pro/) and leading VIP:VR. My full CV can be found [here](http://alinac.me/cv/).


I'm particularly interested in human-computer interaction, game development, spatial computing, and machine learning applications.

I'm __*Alina Christenbury*__, an upcoming PhD student at the [Human Computer Interaction Lab](https://sites.udel.edu/hci-lab/) at the [University of Delaware](https://www.udel.edu/) where my advisor is [Dr. Roghayeh Barmaki](https://sites.udel.edu/rlb/). I'm also part of the [Vertically Integrated Projects](https://vip.udel.edu/) (VIP) program where I'm advised by [Dr. Andy Novocin](http://andy.novocin.com/pro/) and leading VIP:VR, an interdisciplinary undergraduate research project. I also founded the [Delaware Games Collective](http://delawaregamescollective.org), an organization dedicated to connecting game developers, artists, and workers in the state of Delaware. My full CV can be found [here](http://alinac.me/cv/).


I'm particularly interested in game development, spatial computing, and machine learning applications.
